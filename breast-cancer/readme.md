# Breast cancer

N.B. Personal history of "cancer" is a clinical risk phenotype used by the PLCO screening score - in absence of a methylation equivalent, we have opted to predict the most common types of cancer alongside lung cancer

Kresovich et al. 2022 (https://doi.org/10.1002%2F1878-0261.13087) used the top 100 sites from Xu et al.'s EWAS meta-analysis of breast cancer (https://doi.org/10.1093%2Fjnci%2Fdjt045) as candidate features for their prediction model. We have opted to do the same. Weights for the Kresovich predictor are found in Supplementary Table 4, and the top 100 Xu et al. sites are found in Supplementary Table 2 [kresovich_supplement](sources/kresovich_supplement.docx)
