# Prostate cancer t-cell methylation

N.B. Personal history of "cancer" is a clinical risk phenotype used by the PLCO screening score - in absence of a methylation equivalent, we have opted to predict the most common types of cancer alongside lung cancer

3 t-cell methylation specific CpGs from Mehdi et al. 2020 (https://doi.org/10.1186%2Fs12885-020-07078-8), shown in Table 1 in their paper, had high sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy for prediction of prostate cancer, Gleason score and tumor volume of PCa patients
