## Colorectal cancer

N.B. Personal history of "cancer" is a clinical risk phenotype used by the PLCO screening score - in absence of a methylation equivalent, we have opted to predict the most common types of cancer alongside lung cancer

* Wasserkort et al. 2013 present a paper where they jointly explain that sequenced Septin 9 methylation can accurately characterise colorectal cancer, whilst also revealing a commercial panel they have developed (Epi proColonÂ®). In this paper they provide the location and primers for 4 well-performing amplicons in SEPT9 in their study - Amplicons 4, 5, and 6. Supplementary Table S3 provides the chromosome and position of the primers used to obtain the sequence data they used [wasserkort_supplement](sources/wasserkort_supplement)
