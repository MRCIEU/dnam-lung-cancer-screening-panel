# Smoking

In addition to the large number of smoking phenotypes proxied by Maas et al.'s 13 CpG biomarker (ternary smoking status, binary combinations of smoking status, pack years and time since cessation), we have included DNAm biomarkers of constituent chemicals/elements resulting from smoking (lead, cadmium, cotinine) and DNAm biomarkers of specific smoking quitting times (0-5 years, 10, 15, 20 and 30+ years)

## Smoking status:
* 13 CpGs from Maas et al. 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs10654-019-00555-w), taken from their "Table S3 - Association and prediction results of the top 20 CpGs in the model building dataset (N=3,764)" [maas_supplement](sources/maas_supplement.docx)
* 1 CpG from Alex Andrayas' thesis (https://repository.essex.ac.uk/21233/1/Alexandria_Andrayas_MSD_Thesis.pdf; Page 33) which showed zero difference between current and never smokers, but large difference between current and former, and former and never smokers, respectively 

## Chemical constituents of smoking:
* Lead - 59 CpGs from Colcino et al. 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41370-019-0183-9), which are the non-zero coefficients from Table S3 (Patella elastic net coefficients) [colcino_supplement](sources/colcino_supplement.xlsx)
* Cadmium - 6 CpGs from Domingo-Relloso et al. 2020 (https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp6345), the sites and coefficients of which are presented in Table 4 in their paper
* Cotinine - 50 CpGs from Gupta et al. 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13148-018-0606-9), taken from the discovery analysis results presented in Table 1 in their paper

## Smoking quit time:
* 90 CpGs from McCartney et al. 2018 (https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.ebiom.2018.10.051) which correlate excellently with 0-5 years quitting, taken from "Supplementary Table 3: Probe IDs for 90 of the top 100 Joehanes et al. probes present in the GS:SFHS dataset" [mccartney_supplement](source/mccartney_supplement.xlsx)
* 36 CpGs from Guida et al. 2015 (https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddu751) which are associated specifically with 10 years smoking cessation, from Supplementary Table 2 [guida_supplement](source/guida_supplement.xlsx)
* 32 CpGs from Guida et al. 2015 (https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddu751) which are associated specifically with 15 years smoking cessation, from Supplementary Table 2 [guida_supplement](source/guida_supplement.xlsx)
* 27 CpGs from Guida et al. 2015 (https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddu751) which are associated specifically with 20 years smoking cessation, from Supplementary Table 2 [guide_supplement](source/guida_supplement.xlsx)
* 36 CpGs from Joehanes et al. 2016 ()
