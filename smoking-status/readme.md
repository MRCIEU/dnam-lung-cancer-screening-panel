# Smoking

In addition to the large number of smoking phenotypes proxied by Maas et al.'s 13 CpG biomarker (ternary smoking status, binary combinations of smoking status, pack years and time since cessation), we have included DNAm biomarkers of constituent chemicals/elements resulting from smoking (lead, cadmium, cotinine) and DNAm biomarkers of specific smoking quitting times (0-5 years, 10, 15, 20 and 30+ years)

## Smoking status:
* 13 CpGs from Maas et al. 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs10654-019-00555-w), taken from their "Table S3 - Association and prediction results of the top 20 CpGs in the model building dataset (N=3,764)" [maas_supplement](sources/maas_supplement.docx)
