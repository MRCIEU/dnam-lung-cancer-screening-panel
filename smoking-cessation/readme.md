## Smoking quit time:
* 90 CpGs from McCartney et al. 2018 (https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.ebiom.2018.10.051) which correlate excellently with 0-5 years quitting, taken from "Supplementary Table 3: Probe IDs for 90 of the top 100 Joehanes et al. probes present in the GS:SFHS dataset" [mccartney_supplement](source/mccartney_supplement.xlsx)
* 36 CpGs from Guida et al. 2015 (https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddu751) which are associated specifically with 10 years smoking cessation, from Supplementary Table 2 [guida_supplement](source/guida_supplement.xlsx)
* 32 CpGs from Guida et al. 2015 (https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddu751) which are associated specifically with 15 years smoking cessation, from Supplementary Table 2 [guida_supplement](source/guida_supplement.xlsx)
* 27 CpGs from Guida et al. 2015 (https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddu751) which are associated specifically with 20 years smoking cessation, from Supplementary Table 2 [guide_supplement](source/guida_supplement.xlsx)
* 36 CpGs from Joehanes et al. 2016 (https://doi.org/10.1161%2FCIRCGENETICS.116.001506) which do not return to never smoker methylation levels 30 years after smoking cessation, presented in Table 4 in their paper
