## Episcores of proteins associated with imminent lung cancer diagnosis
In Robins et al. 2023 (https://doi.org/10.1038%2Fs41467-023-37979-8), authors present a blood proteome of imminent lung cancer diagnosis, where 36 proteins measured by the Olink Proteomics platform were associated with lung cancer diagnosis (shown in Figure 1 in their paper). Using Gadd et al. 2022 (https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.71802), we used Supplementary Table 1E [gadd_supplement](sources/gadd_supplement.xlsx) to perform a lookup of EpiScores for each of the 36 Robins et al. proteins. Below are numbers of CpGs extracted for each protein which had an EpiScore:
* OSM - 125 CpGs
* EN-RAGE - 82 CpGs
* CXCL9 - 56 CpGs
* VEGFA - 159 CpGs
* TGF-alpha - 100 CpGs
* IGFBP-1 - 120 CpGs
* MMP12 - 257 CpGs
* HGF - 72 CpGs


The following proteins did not have EpiScores present in Gadd et al.:
* ALPP
* SFTPA1
* MUC-16
* LAMP3
* WFDC2
* SYND1
* CASP-8
* IFI30
* CDCP1
* IL6
* CHI3L1
* VWA1
* SCF
* CXL17
* IL2-RA
* CFHR5
* CXCL13
* TNFSF13B
* IGFBP-2
* GDF-15
* CEACAM5
* TFPI-2
* MK
* U-PAR
* S100A11
* ANGPT2
* SPINT1
